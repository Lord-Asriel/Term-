Method makes stuff happen. You can use them inside a brcket with a (0 at the end of them to make them do stuff. On the first line, the .toUpperCase() method is called on the string instance 'Hello'. The result is logged to the console. This method returns a string in all capital letters: 'HELLO'.
On the second line, the .startsWith() method is called on the string instance "Hey". This method also accepts the character 'H' as an input between the opening and closing parentheses. Since the string 'Hey' does start with the letter 'H', the method returns the boolean true.
