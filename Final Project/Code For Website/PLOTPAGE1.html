				<p class="SECRETSAMMYQUANTEMSPAMMYSPENCERWHENCERMRTENSERLENSTERWHENSTER"> Portal's plot is revealed to the player via audio messages or announcements from GLaDOS and visual elements inside rooms found in later levels. According to The Final Hours of Portal 2, the year is established to be somewhere in 2010 —twelve years after Aperture Science's abandonment. The game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about the upcoming test experience. Chell then enters into distinct test chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person. Chell is promised cake and grief counseling as her reward if she manages to complete all the test chambers. Chell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives turn more sinister than her helpful demeanor suggests; although she is designed to appear helpful and encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, and GLaDOS even directs Chell through a live-fire course designed for military androids as a result of mandatory scheduled maintenance in the regular test chamber, as well as having test chambers flooded with a bio-hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS boasts about the fidelity and importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart centered on each face, for helping Chell to complete the chamber. However, GLaDOS then declares that it unfortunately must be euthanized in an emergency intelligence incinerator before Chell can continue. Some of the later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled, such as I don't blame you and No hard feelings.</p>

				<p class="SECRETSAMMYQUANTEMSPAMMYSPENCERWHENCERMRTENSERLENSTERWHENSTER">After Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS congratulates her and prepares her victory candescence, maneuvering Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. As GLaDOS assures her that all Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4,000 degrees [sic] Kelvin (6 740 °F or 3 727 °C), Chell escapes with the use of the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center. GLaDOS becomes panicked and insists that she was only pretending to kill Chell, as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the party escort submission position, lying face-first on the ground, so that a party associate can take her to her reward, but Chell continues anyway. Throughout this section, GLaDOS still sends messages to Chell and it becomes clear that she became corrupt and had killed everyone else in the center, which is also revealed in a later comic. Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as the cake is a lie, and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem The Chariot, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The Reaper and the Flowers, and Emily Brontë's No Coward Soul Is Mine, referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube. GLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements claiming that she is going the wrong way as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Eventually, Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. </p>

				<p class="SECRETSAMMYQUANTEMSPAMMYSPENCERWHENCERMRTENSERLENSTERWHENSTER">GLaDOS continues to plead with and threaten Chell, but during the exchange a sphere falls off; Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple personality cores which the Aperture Science employees allegedly installed after GLaDOS flooded the enrichment center with a deadly neurotoxin gas, and goes on to state that now there is nothing to prevent her from doing so once again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more pieces of GLaDOS, while GLaDOS attempts to discourage her both verbally, with a series of taunts and increasingly juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After she has destroyed the final personality core, a portal malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. One of the final scenes is changed through a patch of the PC version that was made available a few days before Portal 2's announcement; in this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the party escort submission position, revealing the entity to be a party associate. The final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake, and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. One by one a number of the cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout. As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song Still Alive, which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive, that her happy core wasn't disabled.</p>
