A actually good site for Portal.

Act as a replacement to this garbage: http://www.valvesoftware.com/games/portal.html

Websites that inspired me are: http://www.thinkwithportals.com/

https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page



I enjoy this game very much so I want to do a website passed off this. The garbage official website posted above is shocking, and I wish to create a suitable official website for this master piece. For the websites which inspire me, I listed the Portal 2 Website because that website is very nice, though it focuses to much on the games DLC. I also posted the Portal Wiki, because I want my website to have a wiki function to it. I want it to contain a guide to all the games puzzles and have basic explanations to all its game elements. Since the game is very short, this should not be too hard.

As already mentioned this website will contain a guide section for the game, a breakdown of the game's most prominent elements, a work cited page (citing the internet) and of course pages dedicated to promoting the game and providing general information in a optimistic light. This is a recreation of a promotional website after all. A special feature I would like to include if possible is a search bar, capable of recognizing in game elements and specific puzzles.

All coding is a challenge. I want to include a top navigation bar, which is very hard. The search bar will be very hard and basically everything involved in making the website look nice will veryvery hard.
